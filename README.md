## Overview

**PSF Crowding Analyzer** is a Python-based tool designed to analyze Point Spread Function (PSF) crowding in star catalogs. By adjusting the PSF size relative to the pixel size of your sensor, this tool helps astronomers and astrophysicists assess the impact of crowding on observational data. Leveraging interactive graphical widgets within Jupyter Notebooks, users can visualize and manipulate data seamlessly.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** Utilize graphical widgets to dynamically adjust PSF and pixel sizes.
- **Jupyter Notebook Integration:** Designed to work smoothly within Jupyter environments for an enhanced user experience.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Assess crowding effects on star catalogs with customizable parameters.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive controls make it accessible for both beginners and experts in astrophysics.
